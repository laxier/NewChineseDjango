## Project Description

Chinese Learning Platform is a web application for learning the Chinese language that provides users the ability to learn words, track progress, and take tests using flashcards. The application supports various HSK levels and offers functionality for reviewing words based on periods.

## Features

- **Track learning progress**
- **Interactive flashcards for learning**

## Usage

- Track your progress and review words that need more attention.

## Technologies

- **Django** - the main framework
- **Django REST Framework** - for the API
- **JavaScript** - for client-side interactivity
- **HTML/CSS** - for frontend markup

## Future Enhancements

In upcoming versions, I plan to introduce the following features:

- **Interactive Mind Maps**: Enhance the user experience by incorporating interactive mind maps that visually represent connections between words and their meanings. This feature will facilitate better understanding and retention of vocabulary.
  
- **Modal Windows**: When clicking on a character, users will see modal windows displaying the stroke order for writing, helping them learn proper character formation.

- **Word Pages**: Dedicated pages for each word will be created, providing examples and translations to deepen comprehension.
