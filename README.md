## Technologies

- **Django** - the main framework
- **Django REST Framework** - for the API
- **JavaScript** - for client-side interactivity
- **HTML/CSS** - for frontend markup

## Future Enhancements

In upcoming versions, I plan to introduce the following features:

- **Interactive Mind Maps**: Enhance the user experience by incorporating interactive mind maps that visually represent connections between words and their meanings. This feature will facilitate better understanding and retention of vocabulary.

Previously, the project was implemented using Flask, but due to the desire to add new features, it was decided to transition to Django.
